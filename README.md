Hunger is a serious problem worldwide. Technology has advanced incredibly far in recent years to the point where anyone with an internet connection has access to essentially all of human knowledge at their fingertips. With the advent of uber eats, grubhub and the like, people can order food to be delivered straight to their door, even sometimes being delivered by a robot. As such it is disconcerting to learn that roughly 10% of the world’s population - that’s 830 million people - go to sleep hungry at night. Despite this, the issue is not one of scarcity but of distribution. Worldwide an estimated 17% of all food production is wasted, which adds up to an astronomical 1.3 billion tons of food wasted in a year. This much food can go a very long way to helping those hungry people worldwide. Our goal with this project is to analyze data for food scarcity and food surplus worldwide in order to determine an optimal solution for food distribution to those who need it most. Perhaps as an extension to the scope of this project, we can look into methods of distributing such food.
