# AppliedMachineLearning
Final Project, EE695 Group 3

Hunger is a serious problem worldwide. Technology has advanced incredibly far in recent years to the point where anyone with an internet connection has access to essentially all of human knowledge at their fingertips. With the advent of Uber Eats, Grubhub and the like, people can order food to be delivered straight to their door, even sometimes being delivered by a robot. This convenience in first world countries often leads to overordering and increased reliance on restaurants, with less home cooked meals. This in turn leads to more food waste as restaurants have to estimate order quantities and consumers discard leftovers, compared to home-cooked meals from groceries. With all that in mind, it is incredibly disconcerting to learn that roughly 11% of the world’s population - that’s over 830 million people - go to sleep hungry at night. Despite this, the issue is not necessarily one of scarcity but of distribution. Worldwide an estimated 17% of all food production is wasted, which adds up to an astronomical 1.3 billion tons of food wasted in a year. This is a great waste of resources, and we want to investigate this data and apply machine learning to gain some insight into this problem. 
	
For this project, we are investigating food scarcity and food surplus to create a database that catalogs countries and compares data on scarcity and surplus. We will then collect data about these countries including their GDP per capita, infant mortality rate, and life expectancy. Lastly, we will use multiple machine learning methods to estimate the food situation of countries based on these three data sources to evaluate which is most directly related to the food scarcity problem.
